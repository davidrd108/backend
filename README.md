# backend

You'll need to scrape all data from urls.txt into the database. Use backend.sql as a database structure template. The database contains 2 tables: items and comments. I need you to fill all fields of each table by scraping data from urls.  
  
For scraping i'm suggesting (but not assertively) you to use:  
- https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle for curl requests  
- https://github.com/duzun/hQuery.php for parsing html
